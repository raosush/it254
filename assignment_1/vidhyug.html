        <p>
            <u>VidhYug 2.0</u> is an indigenously developed e-Scooter at NITK. This is an extremely useful addition to the NITK eco system. Electric vehicles are seen to be the future of local transportation.
            This paves way for NITK to adapt to the upcoming change. This e-Scooter is proposed to integrate seamlessly with IRIS for rental use at NITK.
